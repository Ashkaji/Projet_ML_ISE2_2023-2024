abstract = {Employee attrition is a major issue among all employee-related issues in the current setting, notwithstanding changes in the external environment. Attrition is defined as a gradual decrease in the number of employees due to seclusion, death, renunciation, and resignations. This research employs logistic regression to forecast whether or not a firm employee will leave. We evaluate job involvement, average monthly hours worked, years employed, gender, education level, and job satisfaction, among other things, as our features. K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and decision trees are more methods for solving this issue. The dataset was divided, with 80% of it being used to train the algorithm and 20% of it being used to test it, yielding a Logistic Regression (LR) accuracy of 88.0952%.},

abstract = {More study into machine learning’s potential uses in corporate settings is warranted in light of rising interest among business executives and stakeholders. The loss of skilled workers would result in less productivity of the organization. In this study, ML approaches is applied to investigate the root reasons for employee dissatisfaction. There were three major studies that employed the IBM Watson-generated dataset to foretell employee turnover. Many different machine-learning models, mostly built from scratch but some using the original lesson dataset, were trained in our initial experiment. Two such models were a small-sample size support vector machine (SVM) and a stochastic K-nearest neighbour (KNN) approach. The dataset is updated using aforementioned machine learning methods and employed the ADASYN synthetic methodology to reduce class disparity in our experiment. In the third trial, data types were manually standardised through an iterative and gradual process. Regarding this, it is found that KNN training on an ADASYN-balanced dataset with a K-size of 3 yielded the best results (0.93 F1-score). Using feature selection and random forest, F1-score up to 0.909 is achieved while using just 12 of the possible 29 characteristics. The accuracy achieved is 85% at value K= 5.It is concluded that this model would help a lot of organizations to Figure out the reasons behind the low performance of the employees. Also, it tries to improve whatever is causing the employees to leave the company.},

abstract = {In today's world, initial and further business development is a challenge. It's a challenge that governs survival or failure of any practical business. The most important resource for any business is Human Resource i.e., its people/employees. Thus, a successful business model is one that ensures a minima of churn rate. As a result, it is important to reduce churn rate and hence increase business growth. The paper talks of a system that helps employers find out factors affecting employee attrition and hence achieve constructive employment. While preparation of proposed system important aspects like data size, type, and number of features are taken into consideration. Models like SVM, Logistic Regression, K Nearest neighbors etc. are implemented and compared against each other to find best fit model in the scope of this research. According to this research random forest is found out to be the best algorithm to investigate employee behavior and finally help in well-timed decision-making process.

abstract = {In any industry, attrition is a big problem, whether it is about employee attrition of an organization or customer attrition of an e-commerce site. If we can accurately predict which customer or employee will leave their current company or organization, then it will save much time, effort, and cost of the employer and help them to hire or acquire substitutes in advance, and it would not create a problem in the ongoing progress of an organization. In this chapter, a comparative analysis between various machine learning approaches such as Naïve Bayes, SVM, decision tree, random forest, and logistic regression is presented. The presented result will help us in identifying the behavior of employees who can be attired over the next time. Experimental results reveal that the logistic regression approach can reach up to 86% accuracy over other machine learning approaches.},

abstract = {Machine learning is an area of application where artificial intelligence is employed empowering the systems to learn and act from experience without the requirement of an explicit program. [1]. Future events can be predicted by executing machine learning algorithms on the available past data [2]. Machine learning produces labeled classifications of data, and it can also be used to form hidden structures from the unlabeled data. The top level management of organizations can leverage this prediction potential of machine learning algorithms to foretell the likelihood of an employee exiting from the organization. This process will in turn help in controlling the factors leading to attrition and prevent it from happening. Employee turnover is a grave challenge faced by the employer. Retaining talents are crucial for every organization. Hence, if the management can obtain a prediction probability of separation of employees, as well as the factors influencing the separation, it can be instrumental in making decisions to mitigate the risk of attrition. This is where machine learning has a role to play. The predictions made by the machine learning algorithms will indicate proactive steps the management should take to retain the employees. This paper is attempting to review the studies conducted in this area to explore various machine learning algorithms that can be used for the predictions and the effectiveness of such predictions.},

abstract = {Throughout the course of careers, a large number of employees encounter a variety of normal life events that can have an impact on their performance and job environment satisfaction. Under these circumstances, some employees are compelled to leave their positions, not because of issues with their work environment, but due to personal circumstances. This is what we refer to as Employee Attrition, a pervasive phenomenon affecting numerous businesses and work environments in the present day. Employee attrition could occur in a variety of ways and be determined by several entities. Therefore, we look into various conditions, causes, indicators, and entities in order to study the attrition problem and determine its answers and enhancements. This study investigated the attrition of employees based on IBM data repository, together with the machine learning based experimental analysis and knowledge discoveries, to identify the most effective approaches to the attrition problem. The experimental data contained 1,471 records with 35 distinct characteristics. We formally employed Nave Bayes Classifier in this study using WEKA datamining software, and adequate knowledge has been extracted to better comprehend employee turnover and their work performance facets.},

abstract = {Attrition is one of the important issues in the modern business world. It is one of the common problems that exists in almost all organisations. The growth of the organization depends upon its employees and stands to sustain vast expenditure to the organization when they leave. Attrition leads to intangible expenditures which are most important than tangible expenditures like training and induction programmes. Every organization has its own efficiency and potential with the help of the employees to withstand the market. Maintaining permanent employees is the biggest challenge for all the organizations in this competitive era. It is one of the major problems in HR analytics. Even long –term employees leaving the industry has also been considered as the loss of employer employee relationships. The purpose of this project is to determine individual characteristics and the organizational constraints that may lead to employee attrition. This study not only helps in predicting attrition but can also see the influencing constraints leading to it. Attributes like age, gender, business travel rate, daily rate, distance from home, education, and field employee number, etc. are collected and Machine learning algorithms are used on a vast dataset consisting of various attributes, to find patterns and predict employee attrition.},

abstract = {The number of positions for data scientists is increasing. The companies working on big data and data science usually receive many registrations for the training programs of the companies before officially giving them a permanent role. Among those trainees, the companies want to know which candidates are really want to work for them or will look for a new employment after training time. This will help to reduce the training cost, and bring higher levels of satisfaction and retention. This work is performed to interpret the main factors impacting to candidate decision and then build a prediction model to predict the probability of a candidate will look for a new job or will work for the company using the current credentials, demographics, experience data, etc. To this goal, different robust machine learning methods are carefully investigated which are single classifiers such as decision trees, naive bayes, KNNs, SVMs and ensemble classifiers such as random forest, voting strategies, Xgboost and LGBM on a public dataset. The experimental results show that the ensemble classifiers have achieved relatively higher performance in comparison to the single classifiers. The LGBM classifier was the best one which yielded up to 80% in the F1 score using the selected feature sets. This research shows promising results and provides a strong preliminary result on this interesting yet unexplored problem.},

abstract = {False and misleading news has spread like wildfire across various social media platforms and newspapers since the 2016 US Presidential elections. Individuals and organizations seeking personal gain manipulate news to fit their biases and spread it among the masses, fueling prejudice. In India, a prominent example is “WhatsApp University” or Godi Media. Manually dealing with this growing issue is time- consuming and tedious. In this paper, we tackle this problem using ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest classification, and K Means Clustering to determine which is the best model for predicting fake news. This process involves training each model on a subset of the dataset and evaluating its accuracy against a separate subset of the data. By comparing the results of each model, we will be able to determine which algorithm is the most effective for our specific problem statement. Our dataset has 12 different attributes, and we display our results through Exploratory data analysis and Data visualization. Our conclusion is that at least 57% of the news is fake, and Logistic Regression is the most suitable model for detecting fake news.},

abstract = {Employee’ determination to leave the organization is one of the significant factors impacting the performance of the organizations since it affects the overall profitability. Organizations need to strategize to reduce the turnover goals of the workers to have a competitive advantage over other organizations. By understanding the factors impacting the employee's intent to leave the organization, the management can intervene with strategic policies and decisions so that intent of the employees to leave the organization will be reduced substantially and thus increasing the employee's engagement towards work. This research paper uses machine learning algorithms to predict an employee's intention to leave the organization in the near future and identifies the significant features impacting the employee's intention to leave the organization. Data has been collected from 416 employees working in IT and ITES companies using convenience sampling and structure questionnaire. Research also used text mining to analyse the open-ended questionnaire filled by the employees there by mining the frequently used words and employee sentiments. From the study, it is found that among the Classification algorithms used for predicting employee's turnover intention, XG boost performed relatively better with high accuracy, recall, precision and f score. Using Logistic Regression, it is found that alternative job opportunity, gender, education, willing to relocate from the workplace, alternative job opportunity, job stress and attitude towards COVID affects the employee's intent to leave the organization to a greater extent.},

abstract = {Employee turnover is a problem that affects any business today. An organization's employee base is reduced by attrition. This may be due to upper management's voluntary resignation or dismissal. It is important for the organisation to be ready for the loss of human capital in which it has invested and from which it has derived revenue. Predicting the risk associated with unequal turnover is thus a profitable concept, allowing management to take preventative steps and make wise decisions for the organization's benefit. A model based on Machine Learning techniques that predicts employee turnover has been developed in this paper. For the full profile of firms, the model is applied and extensively evaluated. It has been shown that the model can be used to increase employee retention. This paper investigates which machine learning algorithm is most effective at predicting which employees are likely to leave a business. We may conclude from the study that Random Forest outperforms other classifiers. It is clear that both external and internal factors play a role in worker deterioration. This investigation will aid the association in determining the elements of representative whittling down and determining a method to limit the rate of weakening.},

abstract = {Modern day machine learning aims to categorize data based on developed models and predict future outcomes according to these models. Today Machine Learning finds its application in various fields such as facial recognition, speech recognition, medical diagnosis for example predicting potential heart failure, sentiment analysis, product recommendations etc. This paper proposes 3 classification models to efficiently predict the Iris flower species. The proposed model uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyse and pre-process the dataset and the prediction is performed by the three classification models namely- "Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)". All the proposed models are tested on Iris dataset and achieved maximum accuracy of 96.43, 98.21 and 94.64 percent respectively. This paper provides a thorough analysis of the various supervised machine learning models that are suitable for predicting the species of Iris flower based on the various attributes like sepal width, sepal length, petal width and petal length.},

abstract = {Employees leave an organization when other organizations offer better opportunities than their current organizations. Continuity and sustenance and even completion of jobs are crucial issues for the companies not to suffer financial losses. Especially if the talented employees, who are at critical positions in the companies, leave the job, it becomes difficult for the organizations to maintain their businesses. Today, organizations would like to predict attrition of their employees and plan and prepare for it. However, the HR departments of organizations are not advanced enough to make such predictions in a handcrafted manner. For this reason, organizations are looking for new systems or methods that automatize the prediction of employee attrition utilizing data mining methods. In this study, we use IBM HR data set and apply different classification methods, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, J48, LogitBoost, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naive Bayes, Bagging, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, to predict the employee attrition. Different from exiting studies, we systematically evaluate our findings with various classification metrics, such as F-measure, Area Under Curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. We observe that data mining methods can be useful for predicting the employee attrition.},

The primary objective of this paper is to predict the GDI Values of various countries by using attributes that are highly correlated with the GDI, using Machine Learning Algorithms such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and K Nearest Neighbours. We have also compared the prediction accuracy of these models to determine the optimal one and we found out that Linear Regression was the most accurate model with 97.30% accuracy. We can further use this model to improvise existing policies to reduce the gender gap in our society.},

abstract = {Several companies and organizations all over the world face redoubtable challenges in recruiting eligible and talented employee candidates, while at the same time enduring the risk of employee attrition caused as a result of death, resignation, or retirement. Employee attrition is one of the key issues that firms face today when endeavoring to retain their valuable and skilled workers. Losing talented employees results in a negative impact on the company's performance. Organizations suffer a huge loss in terms of recruitment costs, training costs, etc. which are incurred for an employee's upliftment. The departure of such employees can also reduce morale, increase stress, and over-burden the team members. Businesses can no longer rely on conventional business practices to promote growth due to the increase of a massive amount of data and the continuously changing preferences. Hence, artificial intelligence and machine learning open up a new realm of possibilities to drive business growth through actionable insights. The objective of this study is to determine why employees depart on their initiative, what might have kept them from doing so, and how to use this information to predict attrition risk. This research study uses three machine learning models to conduct the employee attrition prediction on the IBM Watson dataset having 35 features. The results are described in terms of performance metrics, and the Logistic Regression machine learning method, with an accuracy of 87% and the best recall rate (0.36), generated the best results for the dataset.},

Our model contrasts from other models in-terms of imbalanced data which leads to skewed class proportions creating uneven curve distribution as well as offers a news classification on various domains such as Politics, Sports, Entertainment, Business, Health, etc. “Fake news can imply things like- a mistake, intentional misleading, twisting a new story, or a complete lie”, also panic which was created during the Covid-19 pandemic is not less. Hence our project aims to focus on identifying fake news using the fake news detector so that people who want to have a reality check on specific news of any related topic can verify and get to know whether the information spreading is true or false},

abstract = {Fake news potentially causes serious problems in society. Therefore, it is necessary to detect such news, which is, of course, associated with some challenges such as events, verification and datasets. Reference datasets related to this area face various problems, like the lack of sufficient information about news samples, no subject diversity, etc. The present paper proposes a model using feature extraction and machine learning algorithms for dealing with some of these problems. In the feature extraction phase, two new features (named coherence and cohesion), along with other key features, were extracted from news samples. In the detection phase, initially, the news samples of each dataset were sorted based on a specific order (easier samples in the beginning and harder ones towards the end) using a hybrid method consisting of statistical descriptors and a k‐nearest neighbor algorithm. Then, inspired by the human learning principles, the sorted news samples, were sent to the Long‐Short‐Term Memory and classical machine learning algorithms for the detection of fake news. The obtained results indicated the higher performance of the proposed model in fake news detection compared to benchmark models.},

abstract = {Day by day, usage of social media is increasing amongst the users giving rise to certain issues which need attention. Since information can be shared across social media very quickly, it has become a popular medium of information sharing. Users use these platforms to share information to individuals, groups and to communities. As information is spread across social media platforms very quickly, misinformation also gets spread very quickly. Detecting fake contents is very important at the initial stage so that spread of fake information can be prevented. In existing research most of the research carried out is for English news. Very few researchers have attempted to develop a model for other languages. We present a machine learning solution for fake information identification for Hindi News articles. We carried out experiments on three datasets using various machine learning approaches such as Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Multinomial NB and Random Forest, these learners are used individually, and their performance is evaluated. Then we use these learners in stacking ensemble method and evaluated the performance. To extract features from news TF/IDF is used. Results show that RF performed well over all datasets as individual learner. Ensemble learning resulted in significant improvement in the performance over individual learners in all performance evaluation metrics. In some cases, results of LR are closer to that of RF.},

We must keep in mind that fake news circulated on social media and other platforms can cause problems and false alarms in society. In some cases, false information can cause panic and have a dangerous effect on society and the people who believe it to be true. Along with the virus, the Covid-19 pandemic has also brought on distribution and spreading of misinformation.

This is called textual organization that may be used to classify state of mind or feelings expressed in different ways like: negative, positive, favorable, unfavorable, thumbs up, thumbs down, etc. in the field of Automatic Language Processing (NLP). To solve this kind of problem, sentiment analysis and deep learning techniques are two merging techniques. Because of machine learning ability, deep learning models are effectively used for this purpose. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Naive Bayes algorithm are two popular deep learning architectures to analyze feelings in sentences. These architectures may be used in natural language processing.

This similar trend has also been observed in different movie titles where people recommend or refrain others from watching a movie. Mostly these reviews are in text format and for companies who have received the review need a proper processing to obtain the meaningful information from them.

Although we can leverage the high bandwidth and low latency of shared memory to compute the search phase of the IVFPQ on NVIDIA GPUs, the throughput can degrade due to shared memory bank conflict. To reduce the bank conflict and improve the search throughput, we propose a custom 8-bit floating point value format. This format doesn't have a sign bit and can be converted from/to FP32 with a few instructions. We use this format for IVFPQ on GPUs and achieved better performance without significant recall loss compared to FP32 and FP16.},

Towards this end, we conducted experiments using a series of sampling methods, including oversampling, undersampling, combinesampling, and raising weights to the positive data points (attritted employees). Furthermore, to identify the possible factors involving employee attrition for future prevention, a comparative data analysis was made as well as a principal component factor analysis. The most promising model after combinesampling and factor analysis was Random Forest Classifier and Multi-Layer Perceptron, with Area Under Curve Scores of 0.985 and 0.944, respectively.},
